- add stats to flex on myself
    - goal 1: something that ties into my existing plotting thing so I can see where I'm at


- bugs:
	- appears to be trouble with articles, not due, `Show Next`
	- something wrong with checks? buttons not loaded?
	- also learnign cards should probably not removed from queue, they may be done immediately or anyways much before reload...
	- starting from empty editor still loads last file's bar
