## Mid Prio

- check issues
- settings menu
- usable stats
- add a comment to the button bar
- prevent endless runs of learn cards if there's like 200 due (?)
  - test this scenario
  - well combinable with downloading vocab from vvv
- moore detailed README

## Ideas

- glob style folder exclusions?
- temp filter?
- keyboard/command support?

- 'not today' for longmedia/article 1 day, but 2 days for 'done', as reward?

- sometimes pick longest-not-seen due note, to avoid burying notes completely under the non-perfect randomness


- bring prio back?

- stuff where you input text as answer?
