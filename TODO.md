- add stats to flex on myself
    - goal 1: something that ties into my existing plotting thing so I can see where I'm at


- bugs:
	- also learnign cards should probably not removed from queue, they may be done immediately or anyways much before reload...
	- starting from empty editor still loads last file's bar
	- is *not* starting a learning note handled correctly? think not
- notes that are deleted should be removed from this.notes
- prevent last note immediately being picked again

## Ideas

- glob style folder exclusions?
- temp filter?
- keyboard/command support?
