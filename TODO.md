### Documentation

- need some system, and need to get serious about it

1. User Documentation
    1. make the `README` passable for `gh`
2. start publishing screencasts/screenshots

### Code Quality and Friends

1. create checklist from Obsidian community guidelines 
    - fill in data on `package.json`
2. find a way to do automated tests
    1. take out the obsidian surroundings
    2. unrandomize the random
    3. or: start unit testing what can be tested easily with [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-start-unit-testing-javascript/)


### Ideas

- calendar functionality
    - start with birthdays
- add notices (Toasts)
- dependent learn notes?
    - poetry is just *so* hard
- add empty and non-existing frontmatter to test suite
- do something about long load time...
    - idea: I mean, kind of doesn't matter if it's partly async, as long as we load *some* cards...
- analyze long loading time
    - ideally optimize
    - otherwise add subtle loading animation or smth
- add a kind of `Test` button so that people can see how their note would look like in queue

### Bugs and minor improvements

- notes with no content break the queue
- rename ribbon button, replace icon maybe
- add command?
- add setting for books at the same time
