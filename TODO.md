## High Prio

- release
- get README done

## Mid Prio

- check issues
- settings menu
- usable stats
- add a comment to the button bar

## Ideas

- glob style folder exclusions?
- temp filter?
- keyboard/command support?

- 'not today' for longmedia/article 1 day, but 2 days for 'done', as reward?

- sometimes pick longest-not-seen due note, to avoid burying notes completely under the non-perfect randomness


- bring prio back?


## Bugs

- the following note is coming up way too often (after implementing longestNotSeen function)
