### Documentation

- need some system, and need to get serious about it

1. User Documentation
    1. make the `README` passable for `gh`
2. start publishing screencasts/screenshots

### Code Quality and Friends

1. create checklist from Obsidian community guidelines 
    - fill in data on `package.json`
2. find a way to do automated tests
    1. take out the obsidian surroundings
    2. unrandomize the random
    3. or: start unit testing what can be tested easily with [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-start-unit-testing-javascript/)


### Ideas

- would love the ability to show non-note cards (would be fun at least)
    - or maybe that's shit?
    - but maybe convenient for *oops that last one was a leech* and stuff like that
- implement leech check
    - give cool options, like splitting, adding image, making a mnemonic...
- calendar functionality
    - start with birthdays
- implement house cleaning into the-q
    - *adopt this orphan* would be an obvious start...
    - or a regex or whatever or a `[[]]` or a `#` with *this needs improvement*
- add notices (Toasts)
- dependent learn notes?
    - poetry is just *so* hard
- hook up housekeeping functionality
- add empty and non-existing frontmatter to test suite
- do something about long load time...
    - I mean, kind of doesn't matter if it's partly async, as long as we load *some* cards...

### Bugs and minor improvements

- allow less silly formatted learn cards
- make log work again
