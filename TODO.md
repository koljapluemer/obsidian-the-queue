## Large Scale

* check if this works with fresh vault, and with all kinds of incomplete data!
* find a way to do automated tests
    1. take out the obsidian surroundings
    2. unrandomize the random

* bring back the *excuses* or/and *what would you be willing to do instead*
* implement priority
* handle the fact that notes may be dirty in a million trillion ways (validate cards, essentially), and have elegant fallbacks

## Small Scale

* see that the deck name is used
* at least for habit, stop the 16h hack and go for 4am (?)
* document how the program works lol
* currently, SR uses halflife to as interval. That's trash. But [ebisu](https://github.com/fasiha/ebisu.js) works different to my current paradigm, you're supposed to calculate recall probabilities and then pick the most urgent one, so yes, implement this, but be ready for some more implementation effort.
- shit is being selected that is definitely not due (not just the same card again) [argh]
