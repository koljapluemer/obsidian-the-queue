- bugs:
	- starting from empty editor still loads last file's bar
	- not due learning cards have the right buttons, but are *picked* by the note shuffler (may be state problem though). example note data:
		- could be just the quick picker
		- auto-generate: true

	- is *not* starting a learning note handled correctly? think not (JUST GREEN TEST)
- notes that are deleted should be removed from this.notes
- prevent last note immediately being picked again

## Ideas

- glob style folder exclusions?
- temp filter?
- keyboard/command support?

- 'not today' for longmedia/article 1 day, but 2 days for 'done', as reward?
